- Export/import configurations
- System prompt customization
- Chat history persistence
- Model comparison feature

## Completed on April 2, 2025 ✅

## Performance Optimization (April 3, 2025) ✅

### Issue Identification
- Discovered "Maximum update depth exceeded" error when using the application
- Error was originating from circular dependencies in component effects
- Stack trace pointed to SelectTrigger in ModelConfigForm and state updates in hooks

### Optimization Strategy
1. **Component Memoization**
   - Applied React.memo to ModelConfigForm, ChatInterface, and ModelStatus
   - Created dedicated MessageItem component for chat display
   - Added displayName for better debugging

2. **Hook Optimizations**
   - Refactored useLocalStorage hook to break circular dependency chains
   - Implemented useRef pattern to avoid dependency loops
   - Added equality checks before updating state to prevent unnecessary rerenders

3. **Dependency Management**
   - Fixed useEffect dependency arrays throughout the application
   - Split effects into smaller, more focused hooks with clear responsibilities
   - Used refs to track values without creating new dependencies

4. **Form Handling Improvements**
   - Replaced defaultValue with value prop in Select components
   - Added proper loading states to prevent interaction during updates
   - Memoized form values and handlers to prevent recreation

5. **State Update Patterns**
   - Implemented batch updates for related state changes
   - Used functional updates for state that depends on previous values
   - Applied strategic memoization for computed values

### Results
- Successfully eliminated "Maximum update depth exceeded" error
- Improved application responsiveness and stability
- Verified fixes in both development and production builds
- Application now functions correctly with improved performance characteristics

## Logging System Improvements (April 4, 2025) ✅

### Issue Identification
- Excessive console logs throughout the client-side code
- Recursive object exploration causing performance issues
- Inconsistent logging approaches across components
- Difficulty filtering logs by importance or component

### Implementation Strategy
1. **Unified Logging System**
   - Created a structured Logger class with levels (ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG, TRACE)
   - Implemented component-specific loggers for targeted debugging
   - Added configuration options for enabling/disabling specific log levels
   - Created global configuration system for controlling logging behavior

2. **Smart Object Serialization**
   - Replaced recursive object exploration with JSON.stringify
   - Implemented custom serializer to handle circular references
   - Added depth control for complex nested objects
   - Included protection against large arrays and objects

3. **Code Refactoring**
   - Updated objectExplorer.ts to use the new logging system
   - Maintained backward compatibility for existing code
   - Added deprecation notices to encourage migration to new system
   - Created structured object logging for better readability

4. **Selective Logging Controls**
   - Added ability to filter logs by component/category
   - Implemented runtime log level adjustment
   - Created concise, properly formatted log output
   - Added contextual metadata to logs for better debugging

### Results
- More structured and readable logs in the console
- Significant performance improvement by eliminating recursive object exploration
- Decreased overall logging volume while maintaining important information
- Better debugging experience with consistent log format and levels

- Added safe type assertions for private MLCEngine properties
- Implemented ExtendedMLCEngine interface pattern
- Fixed runtime type validation in useModelStats hook

## 2025-04-09 (Error Handling Improvements)
- Created new ErrorBoundary component for robust error handling
- Implemented error boundaries around critical application components:
  - ChatInterface: Catches and displays errors during model interactions
  - ModelConfigForm: Handles errors during configuration changes
  - StatsDashboard: Prevents dashboard errors from crashing the application
  - Message rendering: Isolates errors to individual messages
- Added component-specific reset and retry capabilities
- Fixed remaining TypeScript issues:
  - Replaced unsafe type casts with proper type assertions

  - Updated state handling to include all required properties
- Successfully built and tested the application with improved error resilience

## 2025-04-09 (Engine Lifecycle Management Fix)
- Fixed critical issue with premature engine unloading:
  - Identified and resolved effect dependency issue causing model to unload immediately after loading
  - Refactored cleanup effect to only run on true component unmount
  - Removed unnecessary dependencies from cleanup effect
  - Added proper isolation between model initialization and cleanup lifecycle
- Resolved ModelNotLoadedError during chat interactions
- Improved error handling and retry mechanism for chat completions
- Enhanced component lifecycle management to preserve engine state
- Verified fix with multiple model loads and chat interactions
